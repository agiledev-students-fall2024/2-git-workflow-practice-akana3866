# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.

This is a link to an article or web site I found interesting related to software development/engineering along with a paragraph or two about what I found interesting about that article.

## What to Know About the Open Versus Closed Software Debate
This article is about the debates about open modifying or copying of A.I technology when developing own software or whether or not it should be closed for safe keeping. I was intriguied by this article in particular because it is interesting to see the differing sides when it comes to technology, especially the differences in reaction between developers and people using the software themselves.

## "Is “open source” better than “closed” when it comes to software development?"
According to the article there are two sides to this arguement. The technolgists with exposure to hardcore hacker culture believe that open source is the way to go because it allows for the generation of new and better technology. On the opposing side, others believe that technology is too powerful and can have heavy societal and cultural implications. In addition, it is extremely expensive to make A.I models, so a paid platform to use is only fair. My take on it is somewhere in between. I think that A.I is extremely expansive technology and the way software developers have used it to improve effeciency has been really great and creative. My only caveat to open source, is the saturation of A.I tech companies that his has introduced into the market. I believe because of this is the reason, many tech startup companies are failing and bigger tech companies are having to scale back. But that's just my take on the whole thing.

Comment: I agree! I think somewhere in between is the way to go, but I must admit I am fighting my own personal bias - open source is awesome!!!
